# Triage community feedback

## Sources

- **GitHub**:
  ```bash
  R=openathleteorg/openathlete
  gh issue list -R $R --state open --json number,title,author,createdAt,comments,labels
  gh pr list -R $R --json number,title,author,createdAt
  gh api graphql -f query='{repository(owner:"openathleteorg",name:"openathlete"){discussions(first:20,orderBy:{field:UPDATED_AT,direction:DESC}){nodes{number title author{login} updatedAt comments{totalCount}}}}}'
  ```
  For each item with activity, read the body and the last comments.
- **Discord**: `DISCORD_FEEDBACK.md` at the repository root. It is a local export, kept out of git through `.git/info/exclude`, and must never be committed or quoted publicly. Check its "Extrait le" date; if it is old, ask the maintainer for a fresh export.
- **Production errors**: when the Better Stack MCP is connected to the OpenAthlete account, look for errors matching the reports.

## Triage

1. Group duplicates across sources, for example a Garmin sync question asked on Discord and in an issue.
2. Check each item against the code and `git log`. It may already be fixed: then the right action is a reply, not work.
3. Classify each item:
   - type: bug, docs, feature, question;
   - severity: data loss, security or legal first, then broken core flows (login, sync, calendar), then the rest;
   - reach: how many people asked.
4. Note who is waiting for an answer and since when. Unanswered people come first, whatever the topic.

## Output

- A prioritized table: item, type, severity, sources with dates, status (fixed in `<sha>` / to do / needs a decision).
- Draft replies, ready to paste. Use the user's language on Discord and English on GitHub. Be short and specific: what was done, what to do now, or a question.
- Proposed GitHub issues for confirmed bugs and accepted features, with reproduction steps and acceptance criteria. Show them to the maintainer before creating them.
