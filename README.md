<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About the Project

# Training infrastructure that respects athletes

Endurance athletes feed years of intimate training data into proprietary U.S. platforms such as TrainingPeaks, Strava, and Garmin Connect, with little practical say in how that data is processed, monetized, or retained.

OpenAthlete is a different proposition: comparable tracking and analysis in an open-source stack, hosted in the EU when you use managed infrastructure, self-hostable when you prefer your own hardware, and with training-load logic you can read and adapt in the repository. It is maintained by an ultra-trail runner based in Grenoble.

### Key Features

- 🇪🇺 **EU-Hosted & GDPR-Native** — Data processed in the European Union
- 🔒 **You Own Your Data** — Self-hostable, full export, no lock-in
- 🔍 **Transparent Algorithms** — Training load formulas (CTL/ATL/TSB) are in the code, auditable, customizable
- 📊 **Comprehensive Tracking** — Workouts, fitness/fatigue/form metrics, progression visualizations
- 🔗 **Device Integrations** — Strava, Garmin, Suunto, Polar, Coros
- 📱 **Mobile Apps** — Native iOS ([TestFlight](https://testflight.apple.com/join/1hBg4mR1)), Android coming
- 🤖 **AI Assistance** — Modest helpers for session generation and load monitoring (not a replacement for a coach)
- 🌐 **Open Source** — AGPLv3, community-driven, sustainably funded

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, please follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Here is what you need to be able to run OpenAthlete.

- **Node.js** (Version: >=22.14.0) - We recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) for version management
- **pnpm** (Version: >=9.x) - Fast, disk space efficient package manager
- **PostgreSQL** (Version: >=13.x) - Database
- **Git** - Version control

> If you want to enable AI features, you may need to obtain API credentials. More details can be found in the [documentation](https://docs.openathlete.org).

## Development

### Setup

1. Clone the repo into a public GitHub repository (or fork https://github.com/openathleteorg/openathlete/fork):

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/openathleteorg/openathlete.git
   cd openathlete
   ```

2. Install packages with pnpm

   ```sh
   pnpm install
   ```

3. Set up your environment variables

   - **Frontend**: Copy `apps/web/.env.example` to `apps/web/.env` and update with your configuration
   - **Backend**: Copy `apps/api/.env.example` to `apps/api/.env` and update with your configuration
   - At minimum, you'll need:
     - `DATABASE_URL` - PostgreSQL connection string
     - `JWT_SECRET` - Secret key for JWT tokens (generate with `openssl rand -base64 32`)
     - `VITE_API_URL` - Backend API URL (for frontend)

4. Setup Node version

   If your Node version does not meet the project's requirements, use nvm:

   ```sh
   nvm use
   ```

   You first might need to install the specific version and then use it:

   ```sh
   nvm install && nvm use
   ```

5. Build shared packages

   ```sh
   pnpm shared build
   ```

6. Set up the database using Prisma

   In a development environment, run:

   ```sh
   pnpm database run db:migrate dev
   ```

   In a production environment, run:

   ```sh
   pnpm database run db:deploy
   ```

7. Run (in development mode)

   ```sh
   pnpm dev
   ```

   This will start:
   - **Frontend** at `http://localhost:5173`
   - **Backend API** at `http://localhost:3000`

### Development Tips

2. Run type checking before committing:

   ```sh
   pnpm tsc:check
   ```

2. Format and lint your code:

   ```sh
   pnpm format:write
   pnpm lint:fix
   ```

### Upgrading from earlier versions

1. Pull the current version:

   ```sh
   git pull
   ```

2. Check if dependencies got added/updated/removed

   ```sh
   pnpm install
   ```

3. Apply database migrations by running <b>one of</b> the following commands:

   In a development environment, run:

   ```sh
   pnpm database run db:migrate dev
   ```

   In a production environment, run:

   ```sh
   pnpm database run db:deploy
   ```

4. Check for `.env` variables changes

   Compare your `.env` files with the `.env.example` files to see if new variables were added.

5. Start the server. In a development environment, just do:

   ```sh
   pnpm dev
   ```

   For a production build, run for example:

   ```sh
   pnpm build
   pnpm start
   ```

6. Enjoy the new version.

<!-- DEPLOYMENT -->

## Deployment

### Self-hosting with Docker

On any server with Docker and its Compose plugin:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openathleteorg/openathlete/main/scripts/install.sh | sh
```

OpenAthlete then runs on `http://localhost` from the published images, with new random secrets in `openathlete/.env`. Add `-s -- --domain openathlete.example.org` to serve your domain over HTTPS with automatic certificates. Run the script again to update.

The [self-hosting guide](https://docs.openathlete.org/docs/getting-started/self-hosting) covers HTTPS, device sync, AI, backups and upgrades from older setups.

### Manual Deployment

For detailed deployment instructions, see our [self-hosting documentation](https://docs.openathlete.org/docs/getting-started/self-hosting).

#### Backend (NestJS)

1. Build the application:

   ```bash
   cd apps/api
   pnpm install
   pnpm build
   ```

2. Set up environment variables in `.env`

3. Run database migrations:

   ```bash
   pnpm database run db:deploy
   ```

4. Start the server:

   ```bash
   pnpm start:prod
   ```

#### Frontend (React + Vite)

1. Build the application:

   ```bash
   cd apps/web
   pnpm install
   pnpm build
   ```

2. Serve the built files using a web server (nginx, Apache, etc.)

   Example nginx configuration:

   ```nginx
   server {
       listen 80;
       server_name your-domain.com;

       root /path/to/apps/web/dist;
       index index.html;

       location / {
           try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
       }
   }
   ```

### Environment Variables

#### Backend Required Variables

```properties
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@host:5432/openathlete"
JWT_SECRET="your-secret-key"
NODE_ENV="production"
```

#### Frontend Required Variables

```properties
VITE_API_URL="https://api.your-domain.com"
```

For a complete list of environment variables, see the `.env.example` files in each app directory.

### Self-hosted mode without billing

Set `SELF_HOSTED=true` in `apps/api/.env` for local development, or in the
Compose environment when running containers. The default is `false`, preserving
the subscription-based behavior. Restart the API after changing this setting.

Self-hosted mode does not initialize Stripe, grants AI features to authenticated
users, removes subscription athlete limits, and hides billing settings. JWT
authentication and athlete/coach authorization still apply. Billing operations
are unavailable; existing subscription records are not upgraded or deleted.

Users can add their own AI keys in **Settings → AI**. The instance can also
supply keys (`OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`...), and `AI_MODEL_DEFAULT`
or `AI_PROVIDER=anthropic` puts every instance model on one provider; individual
models can still be overridden with `AI_MODEL_*` variables in the `provider/model`
format. Claude has no audio input, so voice-note transcription uses OpenAI by
default; set `AI_TRANSCRIPTION_PROVIDER=google` to use
`GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY` instead. See [docs/ai-providers.md](docs/ai-providers.md).
Provider usage is billed separately. This setting
does not change prompts, models, workout validation, or the review-before-save
flow for generated sessions. It is a server setting, not a `VITE_` variable.

### Optional manual activity tools

Manual FIT uploads and the unofficial Garmin connector are disabled by default.
For a clean installation, leave both server flags unset or set them to `false`
in `apps/api/.env`:

```dotenv
ENABLE_MANUAL_FIT_IMPORT=false
ENABLE_MANUAL_GARMIN_SYNC=false
```

Enable either tool independently with `true`, restart the API and reload the
application. These are installation-wide server settings, not `VITE_` variables.
Garmin manual additionally requires `SELF_HOSTED=true`, an absolute
`GARMIN_UNOFFICIAL_DIRECTORY` and the existing Python/session setup. Setting only
`SELF_HOSTED` or the Garmin directory no longer enables the unofficial connector.

When disabled, the FIT upload action and the Garmin manual card/table column are
hidden and their manual write endpoints reject requests. Official Garmin/Strava
connections and previously imported activities, metrics and maps remain available.
See [manual FIT import](docs/manual-fit-import.md) and
[manual Garmin setup](scripts/garmin-probe/README.md) for enabling each tool.

Official provider credentials must also be configured separately; see
[connector configuration and unavailable states](docs/provider-configuration.md).
